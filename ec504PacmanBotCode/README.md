# ec503PacmanBot


The three difficulty levels are separated into three separate folders:
1. Easy level: SmallGrid_1Ghost
2. Medium level: SmallGrid_2Ghost
3. Hard level: Wall+Muliple

In each these folders, the algorithms are written in the following files:
heuristic_policy.py (only for Easy Level)
policyIteration.py
valueIteration.py
qLearning.py

Each of these files computes the policy and saves them to a text file.
These text files are already in the folder for immediate use.
In each of the three folders, there is game_simulation.py that takes a text file, reads in the policy, 
and runs the Pacman game with visuals.
